# 💤 Sleep Health and Lifestyle Analysis (EDA + Machine Learning)

Sleep plays a major role in physical and mental well-being. Poor sleep habits are often linked with lifestyle factors such as stress, physical activity, BMI and cardiovascular health.

This project explores a Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset to identify patterns affecting sleep disorders and build a machine learning model to predict them.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on sleep and lifestyle features  
- Visualize trends and relationships between health indicators  
- Build a classification model to predict the presence of sleep disorders  

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset for analysis  
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations and correlation plots  
- Built a Logistic Regression model for sleep disorder classification  
- Evaluated the model using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report and ROC-AUC    

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model
A **Logistic Regression** model was trained for binary classification after scaling numerical features and encoding categorical features.

### 📊 Model Performance
- **Accuracy:** ~0.94  
- **ROC-AUC Score:** ~0.94
- Evaluation metrics used:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
  - ROC Curve

---

## 📌 Major Insights
- Individuals with sleep disorders generally show- Lower sleep duration, Lower sleep quality and Higher stress levels  
- Blood pressure, BMI and age were found to be strong contributing factors, while physical activity showed protective effects.
